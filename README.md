# ittywiki

ittywiki is a small, flat-file wiki.

it's written in php, so all your edits go live as soon as you upload them; there's no need to run a script to recompile your wiki just to fix a nasty typo.

every page is written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), with additional wiki features like linking, page summaries, and tooltips to make writing pages a breeze.
