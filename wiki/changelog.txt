[^summary]: you are running version 1.1.

# 1.1
- remove smartypants entirely
- switch to parsedown
- optional page table of contents (based on headers) to side of page
- link to any header on the page

# 1.0.1
- default wiki typo fixes
- cleaned up `.htaccess` url routing (no longer using hard-coded css/js access)
- turn debug mode off by default
- make smartypants a setting (default off)
- make external links blue (internal links are still red)

# 1.0
- initial release
	- flat-file structure
	- markdown formatting
	- basic wiki syntax


## Roadmap
- better markdown css
- automatic summaries for pages without a summary footnote
- responsive design
	- fix tooltips on mobile
- "command" pages (add colon to end of path, like `:cmd`) to view page metadata, deadlinks, and other info - different commands do different things, of course
