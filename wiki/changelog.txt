[^summary]: you are running version 1.0.

# 1.0
- initial release
	- flat-file structure
	- markdown formatting
	- basic wiki syntax


## Roadmap
- markdown css optimizations
- automatic summaries for pages without a summary footnote
- responsive design
- "command" pages (add colon to end of path, like `:cmd`) to view page metadata, deadlinks, and other info - different commands do different things, of course
