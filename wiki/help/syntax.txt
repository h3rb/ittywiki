# ittywiki Syntax

[markdown]: http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/

all ittywiki files are written in [Markdown][markdown], but a few additional wiki features have been added.

for information on how to write in Markdown, please visit [John Gruber's site][markdown].


## Page Titles

page titles default to the name of the file, minus its extension(s), with every word uppercased.

for instance, the file "`hello there ittywiki.many.extensions`" will result in the title "Hello There Ittywiki."

however, if you include a Markdown header ("#") on the first non-blank line of the file, the content of this header is used as the title. the header level does not make any difference.

note that the header will be stripped from the body of the file if you do this.


## Tooltips

to create a tooltip, a special bracketed syntax is used:

<code>[body text]\{tooltip text}</code>

this is rendered as:
[body text]{tooltip text}  
(hover over the body text to view the tooltip)

tooltips are useful for adding additional detail to a wiki page that may be interesting or insightful, but also unecessary. rather than bore the reader with this information, you can hide it unless they want to see it.


## Linking

obviously a key feature to any wiki is linking.

ittywiki uses the standard double brace syntax for linking:

<code>[\[link to file]]</code>

note that links are based on the file name, not the page's title.

since ittywiki allows you to have multiple pages with the same name, you can specify a path to a specific file via forward slash ("/"):

<code>[\[specific directory/file]]</code>

by default, links' body content will match the content within the brackets, but you can change this via pipe ("|"):

<code>[\[body text|link to file]]</code>

note that if you do not specify a path to your file and there are multiple files with the same name, the file closest to the root will be chosen.

you can also add prefixes and suffixes to links by placing them before the braces:

<code>prefix-[\[link]]-suffix</code>

this renders as: prefix-[[link]]-suffix

prefixes and suffixes are placed before or after the braces but cannot contain any whitespace.

dead links are rendered slightly darker:  
[[deadlink]]

if a page links to itself, the "link" is simply bolded and not hyperlinked:  
[[link to self|syntax]]

### Page Summaries

pages can provide summaries via Markdown footnote syntax:

`[^summary]: this is a page summary`

if a summary is provided, links to that page will include a tooltip containing the summary contents.

for instance:  
[[summary demo]]
