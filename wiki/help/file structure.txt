ittywiki is designed to make content creation fast and easy. creating pages is as simple as creating files and folders.

all wiki data is stored in the `wiki` folder.

system files are stored in the `core` folder. updates can be applied to the `core` folder without touching your wiki content.


## Folders

folders act as organization tools for ittywiki. you can have infinite nested folders and infinite files in any particular folder.

folders are also necessary if you want two pages with the same name.

by default, wiki folders display a list of their contents and child folder contents when viewed in the browser. this makes it easy to quickly index many pages at once. for an example, check out the "[[help]]" folder.


## Files

every wiki page is simply a file. page names are the file name, excluding all extensions extensions start with a period (".") and go until the end of the file name. files can have multiple extensions.


## Index Files

if a file named "index" is placed at the root of a folder, it is displayed rather than the file list when that folder is viewed in the browser.
